## Steps to run the Application

Since Its a node based application setup I have removed the node_modules folder from the package.
- extract the package and open it in VS code.
- Go to terminal and run the command  - npm i
- It will add the neccessary packages to required by the application such as three.JS
- click on live server button and you will be able to see the running application on the browser.
